# UnityLevelEditor2D
A simple 2D Level Editor for Unity working in Scene View

![Level Editor Example](http://nerdangolo.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DemoLevelEditor.png)

This is a simple tool for the [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) game engine that allows developers to
quickly build 2d tile-based levels by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor.

This tools work in scene view, so no object are instantiated at runtime.

**Features**:

* Multiple tiles support.
* Sequential tile loops (to spawn tiles following a specific pattern).
* Randomic tile loops (to spawn a random tile from a predefined pool).
* Grid reference (different colors and hideable).
* Tiles auto-snapping to grid.
* Simple palette-based interaction (click on a tile button in the inspector then left click to add a tile, right click to remove it).
* Multiple tiles insertion/removal (By clicking and dragging).
* Reinstantiate all tiles function.
* Reset level to clear the whole level.
